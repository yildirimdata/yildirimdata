- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @yildirimdata.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about the field of data science and data analysis.

- ðŸŒ± On my GitHub account, you'll discover a wide range of notebooks and scripts covering various aspects of data science. These include projects related to Python programming, statistical analysis, SQL queries, Tableau visualization, and data analysis using powerful Python tools like NumPy and Pandas. Additionally, I have curated several notebooks exploring the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and natural language processing techniques. Furthermore, I delve into the deployment of these models using AWS, EC2, Sagemaker, and tools like Streamlit. I consistently update my repository with new resources on machine learning, deep learning, Scikit-learn, NLP, Docker, and other tools for data collection, assessment, and interpretation. Be sure to check back for updates!

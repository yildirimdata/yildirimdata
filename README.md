- 👋 Hi, I'm @yildirimdata.

- 👀 I'm passionate about the field of data science and data analysis.

- 🌱 On my GitHub account, you'll discover a wide range of notebooks and scripts covering various aspects of data science. These include projects related to Python programming, statistical analysis, SQL queries, Tableau visualization, and data analysis using powerful Python tools like NumPy and Pandas. Additionally, I have curated several notebooks exploring the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and natural language processing techniques. Furthermore, I delve into the deployment of these models using AWS, EC2, Sagemaker, and tools like Streamlit. I consistently update my repository with new resources on machine learning, deep learning, Scikit-learn, NLP, Docker, and other tools for data collection, assessment, and interpretation. Be sure to check back for updates!

- 💞️ I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that allow me to enhance my data analysis and data science skills while making a meaningful contribution to creating a fair world free from "cognitive" biases. I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to drive positive change and promote fairness and equality. If you have a project that aligns with these goals, I would be thrilled to explore potential collaborations and make a meaningful impact together.

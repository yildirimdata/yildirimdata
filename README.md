- 👋 Hi, I’m @yildirimdata
- 👀 I’m interested in  data science, data analysis, network analysis and cluster analysis. The use of SQL and main Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ScipPy for analysing and assessing data is one of my main interests. 

- 🌱 You can find numerous notebooks and scripts in my GitHub account related to python, statistics, SQL, Tableau, data analysis with python tools such as NumPy, Pandas and data visualisation with Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn. I'm adding regularly new sources for Machine Learning, Deep learning, Scikit, NLP, Docker and other tools to collect, assess and interpret data. So, check it again in the future!
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which will enable me to improve my data analysis/visualization skills and to make a contribution for a fair world without "cognitive" biases.

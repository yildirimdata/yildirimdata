- 👋 Hi, I’m @yildirimdata
- 👀 I’m interested in phyton, data science, data analysis, network analysis and cluster analysis. I'm especially curious about the use of digital tools on historical data. 
- 🌱 After a boot camp on python, statistics, data analysis with python tools such as NumPy, Pandas and data visualisation with Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn, I’m currently learning SQL, Machine Learning, Deep learning, Scikit learn, NLP, Docker and other tools to collect, assess and interpret data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which will enable me to improve my data analysis/visualization skills and to make a contribution for a fair world without "cognitive" biases.
- 📫 It's easy to reach me. Just send an e-mail at: yildirimkdata@gmail.com
